Description: BuildManager, or bm, is a program that wraps and extends rpm while building
        packages. Its features allow one to batch process thousand of RPMS at once,
        controling logs, rpm and srpm moving, filtering the list of files, ignoring
        given packages, completely cleaning the build directories, and many other
        features.
